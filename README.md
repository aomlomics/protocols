# AOML Omics Protocols

The repository contains protocols used by AOML Omics labs, made using the [BeBOP-OBON protocol templates](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template). 

## Protocols by category

### Sample collection

* [Water sampling protocol (Sterivex)](https://github.com/aomlomics/protocols/blob/main/protocol_sampling_Sterivex.md)

### DNA extraction

* [DNA extraction protocol (Sterivex)](https://github.com/aomlomics/protocols/blob/main/protocol_DNA_extraction_Sterivex.md)

### Metabarcoding (amplicon) library prep

* [16S V4-V5 (bacteria) metabarcoding library prep protocol (for Illumina)](https://github.com/aomlomics/protocols/blob/main/protocol_PCR_16S_V4V5.md)
* [18S V9 (protists & metazoa) metabarcoding library prep protocol (for Illumina)](https://github.com/aomlomics/protocols/blob/main/protocol_PCR_18S_V9.md)
* [12S MiFish (fish) metabarcoding library prep protocol (for Illumina)](https://github.com/aomlomics/protocols/blob/main/protocol_PCR_12S_MiFish.md)

### Metagenomic (shotgun) library prep

* [Metagenomic library prep protocol (Nextera for Illumina)](https://github.com/aomlomics/protocols/blob/main/protocol_metag_nextera.md)

## How to use

Clicking on a protocol above will take you to the Markdown file of the protocol on GitHub. To download the protocol, click on the "Download raw file" button on the right side of the tool bar above the document. To view and/or print the protocol, open the Markdown file in a Markdown editor such as [Typora](https://typora.io).

## Versioning

The protocols here are complete but may undergo formatting and minor content changes. Versioning will be done by releasing versions of this repository to Zenodo. In most cases, versions will be linear modifications to existing protocols, and version numbers will be sufficient to track them. In cases where variations require multiple protocol versions to coexist, multiple protocols will be maintained.
