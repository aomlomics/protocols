| Field negative control | Negative control created during sampling. Usually distilled (DI) water run through a Sterivex filter in place of a seawater eDNA sample. This will act as a control for contamination during field sampling. |
| Niskin bottle | Plastic cylindrical bottle used for collecting water samples at different depths. Comes in a variety of volumes. |

# BACKGROUND

## Summary

This protocol describes collection and filtration of marine eDNA samples using Sterivex cartridge filters and can be adapted to collect water samples from individual Niskin bottles, CTD Niskin rosettes, or flow through systems. This protocol is used by NOAA's AOML GO-SHIP collaborators.

## Method description and rationale

This protocol is used to pump sea water samples collected via Niskin bottle, CTD Niskin rosettes or flow through systems and pump it through a 0.22 uM Sterivex filter using a peristaltic pump. Sterivex filters are loaded with Zymo ZR BashingBeads prior to pumping and DNA/RNA preservative is immediately added post-pumping to better preserve eDNA and expedite DNA extraction upon processing in the lab. The recommended filtration volume for GO-SHIP samples is ~8 liters, which takes ~2 hours. Precautions are taken to minimize contamination of samples by thoroughly sterilizing all equipment prior to use. 

## Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance

This protocol can be used across any marine environment to effectively collect water samples for biodviersity monitoring. This protocol can tolerate a wide range of depths for sampling - NOAA's AOML samples from 1m up to 1000m.

# PERSONNEL REQUIRED

One person with pipetting experience. Research vessel experience is recommended but not required.

## Safety

There are no major safety concerns with this protocol. Standard precuations should be taken such as wearing PPE at all times to avoid skin and eye exposure especially when working with bleach.

## Training requirements

Standard moleculary biology training including sterile technique and pipetting technique is required to properly conduct this protocol. Research vessel experience is recommended. Personnel should be trained in filtering protocol prior to conducting on ship.

## Time needed to execute the procedure

The process of setting up sampling equipment and filtering seawater will take ~2 hours (depending on number of samples).

# STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

## Protocol

## Sampling

Preparation

1. Prepare a 2% bleach solution by diluting 5% household bleach with DI water and storing in an 8 L carboy.
2. Wearing gloves, prepare the Sterivex filters by carefully adding 1 tube of Zymo ZR BashingBeads. It is recommended to cut off the top half of a 1000 uL tip and place it into the top of the Sterivex filter to act as a funnel while pouring beads into the Sterivex. 
3. Label each Sterivex filter with a pre-printed sticker.
4. Attach hose-barb adapter to one end of peristaltic pump tubing.
5. Attach serological pipette to other end of peristaltic pump tubing.
6. Sterilize 60 mL syringe with 2% bleach.

Sampling

1. Rinse 20-L carboy 2 times with ~100 mL of sample water (200 mL total)
2. Wearing gloves, collect water from the flow-through system (or Niskin bottles) into 20-L carboy.
3. Place serological pipettes into bag(s) or bottle(s), ensuring the other end of the tubing (with hose-barb) is flowing into the graduated cyclinders.
4. Turn on the pump and run ~100 mL of seawater to prime the tubing.
5. Run the pump at 100-150 rpm.
6. Pause the pump and discard water.

Filtration

1. Attach the Sterivex filter input to the hose-barb that is already attached to the tubing outflow. The filter should screw on tightly. Avoid handling Sterivex filter input or output ends.
2. Run the pump and filter seawater until ~8 L has been filtered, measured using the graduated cyclinders or another container.
3. On the log sheet, record the date, time, latitute, longitude, volume filtered and any notes about the sample. This information should be entered into an Excel spreadsheet every few days to maintain a digital copy in addition to the paper copy.
4. Pause pump and open pump head valves to release pressure.
5. Unscrew and remove Sterivex filters from the hose-barb adapters.
6. Gently remove any excess seawater from the filters using a sterilized 60 mL syringe.
7. Cap the bottom end (outlet) of the Sterivex filter with a female luer-lock cap.
8. In between filtering different water samples, rinse out the tubing with 2% bleach solution, followed by DI water. Then proceed with the next volume of seawater.

Sample preservation

1. Using a P1000 (1000 uL pipette), gently add 1000 uL of DNA/RNA Shield preservative into the Sterivex.
2. Cap the top end (inlet) of the Sterivex with a male luer-lock cap.

Storage

1. Freeze at ≥ –20 °C until extraction.

Post-Sampling
1. Return the bottle of DNA/RNA Shield to a refrigerator to reduce contamination.
2. Run ~1 L of 5% bleach through the lines to clean pump tubing. Repeat with ~1 L of deionized water.
3. Rinse the 20 L collection carboy 3 times with ~0.5 L DI water (1.5 L total) after sampling.

## Quality control

Negative field controls are included with every research cruise. After the addition of Zymo ZR BashingBeads to a new Sterivex filter, DI water is filtered in place of sea water and then DNA/RNA Shield is added. These Sterivex are stored the same as other sample Sterivex.

## Basic troubleshooting guide

Leaks
- If there is a leak present in the pump setup, you will notice trouble pulling water through the pump system. Check all seals and re-attach tubing.

Clogged Filter
- If a filter is clogged, turn valves and connections off and attempt to clear obstructions (i.e. large chunks of sediment or algae). Make note of any abnormal conditions and try to pump the full volume of seawater through the filter.
