  <section1 title="BACKGROUND">
    <section2 title="Summary">
      <paragraph>This protocol describes steps for performing PCR for 16S marker gene regions using eDNA extracted from Sterivex at NOAA's AOML. There are several optional steps at the end of the protocol including using AMPure beads to clean up PCR products. Some steps (e.g. PCR plate preparation, AMPure bead cleanup, sequencing plate dilutions) have been or can be optimized for use with the Opentrons OT2 robot. This protocol closely aligns with the following 16S protocol: https://www.protocols.io/view/fuhrman-lab-515f-926r-16s-and-18s-rrna-gene-sequen-j8nlkpd1g5r7/v2?step=102.</paragraph>
    </section2>
    <section2 title="Method description and rationale">
      <paragraph>This protocol is used for PCR amplifying the 16S V4-V5 marker gene regions of environmental DNA. Fluidigm adapter are already present on the primers described in the following protocol. It is highly reproducible and can easily be adapted for any number of samples (i.e. a full 96-well plate or a few samples).</paragraph>
    </section2>
    <section2 title="Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance">
      <paragraph>This protocol can be used to amplify the 16S marker gene region of any eDNA sample.</paragraph>

      <section3 title="Quality control, PCR clean-up">
        <paragraph>2% Agarose Gel</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Following PCR amplification, run products through 2% agarose gel to confirm presence of target bands:</paragraph>
        <paragraph>1. Make stock solution of TBE buffer (1x) in a 1-L glass container by adding 100 ml of stock TBE buffer (10x) to 900 ml DI water.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>2. For a 5.5in x 5.5in gel tray, mix 200 ml of TBE buffer (1x) and 4 g of agarose in a flask. Use scale to weigh agarose.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>3. Microwave mixture for 1 minute, followed by 15-30 second intervals. Watch carefully after 1 minute - mixture can bubble out of flask! The agarose should be fully dissolved so that the solution is mostly clear. Wear a protective glove when handling flask as the mixture will be hot.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>4. Allow for gel mixture to cool in flask for 5-10 min. While cooling, set up gel tray (5.5in x 5.5in) in gel box. Make sure the tray is oriented properly and sealed tight for gel pouring. Add two gel combs for 20 wells each lane - total of 40 wells.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>5. Once cooled to 50°C, add 20 ul of SYBR safe to the mixture and swirl the flask gently to mix (don't create bubbles!). SYBR safe is light sensitive so after adding to mixture, immediately close the vial and store in the dark.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>6. Pour the gel mixture and remove any bubbles using a pipette tip.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>7. Allow gel to set for 30-45 min.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>8. Cut large strips of parafilm or use 8-strip tubes and label each sample as a position on the parafilm/tubes.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>9. Pipette 1 ul of blue loading dye onto each sample position or into each tube.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>10. Pipette 5 ul of DNA sample into loading dye and pipette to mix 2-3 times.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>11. Once the gel is set, fill the gel box with enough TBE buffer (1x) to fully submerge the gel beneath ~1cm of buffer.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>12. Carefully add samples (6 ul each) to gel and write down their positions.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>13. Add 6 ul of ladder dye (green) to gel.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>14. Run gel at 100 V for 40-50 min then visualize on gel reader machine.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>(OPTIONAL) Purify PCR products using AMPure beads protocol (optimized for Opentrons)</paragraph>
        <paragraph>1. Follow along with AMPure XP beads manufacturer protocol (begins on page 5 of manual - https://www.beckmancoulter.com/wsrportal/techdocs?docname=B37419).</paragraph>
        <paragraph>2. Will need magnetic plate and fresh 70% ethanol.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>3. Adjust bead ratio - 0.8x beads to sample volume for 16S.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>4. End product will be ~40 ul of cleaned DNA eluted in molecular grade water.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>(OPTIONAL) Run Qubit on final PCR Products</paragraph>
        <paragraph>1. Follow manufacturer protocol for running Qubit: https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/Qubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>(OPTIONAL) Run Second 2% Agarose Gel on Purified PCR Products</paragraph>
        <paragraph>1. Follow along with previous gel instructions.</paragraph>
      </section3>
    </section2>
    <section2 title="Quality control">
      <paragraph>The inclusion of a negative control for PCR is to confirm the absence of contamination during the process. The inclusion of a positive control (mock community) is to confirm the PCR is amplifying DNA. There are several optional steps at the end of the process to confirm the presence and concentration of amplified DNA.</paragraph>
    </section2>
    <section2 title="Basic troubleshooting guide">
      <paragraph>Low Volume Post-PCR</paragraph>
      <paragraph>- If using strip-caps, ensure they are tightly fitting on wells. Any gap in the lid will allow for some volume to evaporate during the PCR process on the thermal cycler. If using PCR plate seals, spin down the plate after taking it off the thermal cycler to ensure all condensation is drawn back into the well.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Contamination</paragraph>
      <paragraph>- If there are contamination bands appearing on the gel, run another PCR ensuring full sterilization of work spaces and equipment under the hood and use new vials of AmpliTaq Gold and molecular water. If diluted primers are contaminated, use freshly-made aliquot of primers.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Weak Amplification</paragraph>
      <paragraph>- If you are seeing weak amplification bands on the gel, ensure the master mix and DNA is being fully mixed. You can also increase the concentration of primers or tweak the PCR process on the thermal cycler (increasing # of cycles of PCR or optimize annealing temperature). The addition of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) to master mix is also useful in some cases.</paragraph>
