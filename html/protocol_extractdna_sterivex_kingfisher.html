<h2 id="background">BACKGROUND</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>This protocol is used for DNA extraction of sea water eDNA samples
from sterivex filters using contents of a ZymoBIOMICS 96 Magbead DNA Kit
and a KingFisher Flex robot. Optional use of Opentrons OT-2 Robot to
prepare plates for KingFisher. This protocol is used by the Molecular
and Computational Biodiversity group of NOAA’s AOML.</p>
<h3 id="method-description-and-rationale">Method description and
rationale</h3>
<p>This protocol is optimized for high throughput DNA extractions of
sterivex filters. It is easily reproducible and generates sufficient DNA
yields while minimizing contamination and time requirements through the
use of a KingFisher and optional use of an Opentrons OT-2 Pipetting
Robot.</p>
<h3 id="spatial-coverage-and-environments-of-relevance">Spatial coverage
and environment(s) of relevance</h3>
<p>This protocol has been used to extract DNA from thousands of sea
water eDNA samples taken from stations off of South Florida coasts
(Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico). Sample collection depths range from
1m to 200m in the epipelagic zone (marine photic zone
[ENVO:00000209]).</p>
<h2 id="personnel-required">PERSONNEL REQUIRED</h2>
<p>One person with molecular biology experience.</p>
<h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>

<h3 id="dna-extraction-protocol">DNA extraction Protocol</h3>
<h4 id="preparation">Preparation</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sterilize all workspaces and durable equipment with 70% EtOH.</li>
<li>Label 94 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes 1 through 94 and place in
96-well tube rack.</li>
<li>Fill large ice bin with ice.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="extraction">Extraction</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Remove Sterivex from freezer and immediately place on ice while
randomizing the order of the filters.</p></li>
<li><p>If Sterivex are wrapped in aluminum foil, remove foil and ensure
all Sterivex have filter caps on either end (male and female).</p></li>
<li><p>If Sterivex do not already contain zirconia beads and DNA/RNA
Shield, add as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the male luer plug from the inlet port.</li>
<li>Remove any liquid from the inlet port using a sterile swab or
twisted piece of KimWipe.</li>
<li>Pour beads from ZR BashingBead Lysis Tubes (0.1 &amp; 0.5 mm) into
the inlet port. If water has been removed, this should be easily done.
If beads get stuck, use a pipette tip to unclog them.</li>
<li>Add 1 mL ZymoBiomics Lysis Buffer or 1:10 dilution of DNA/RNA Shield
to the Sterivex using a pipette.</li>
<li>Replace the male luer plug in the inlet port.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Number the filters sequentially and use scanner to scan QR codes
(cryo-babies labels) onto a google sheet or other form of processing
log. If Sterivex do not have QR codes, record the numbers with their
corresponding sample names in a google sheet or lab notebook.</p></li>
<li><p>Vortex for 40 minutes via Vortex Genie at speed ~6. Make sure the
proper adjustable head is secured, which has brackets that fit the
Sterivex filters. If brackets are loose and Sterivex are falling out,
wrap a small portion of parafilm around the outside of the Sterivex and
secure in bracket.</p></li>
<li><p>While vortexes are running, prepare KingFisher plates by hand
using a repeater pipette:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample Plates (3): Add 600 µl of MagBinding Buffer and 25 µl of
MagBinding beads to each well.</li>
<li>Wash 1: Add 500 µl of ZymoBiomics MagWash 1 to each well.</li>
<li>Wash 2-1: Add 900 µl of ZymoBiomics MagWash 2 to each well.</li>
<li>Wash 2-2: Add 900 µl of ZymoBiomics MagWash 2 to each well.</li>
<li>Elution: Add 150 µl of ZymoBiomics RNAse Free Water to each
well.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>OR</p>
<p>(OPTIONAL) Prepare KingFisher plates with Opentrons OT-2 Pipetting
Robot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on OT-2 Robot and computer, open Opentrons program and begin
protocol setup.</li>
<li>Place 200 uL filter tips in correct slot of deck.</li>
<li>Carefully fill 12-well reservoir with reagents:
<ul>
<li>Fill the first two columns 1/2 way full with DNA/RNAse Free
Water.</li>
<li>Fill columns five, six, seven and eight completely with MagWash
1.</li>
<li>Place reservoir in correct deck slot of Opentrons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Place a deep single-well reservoir in the MagBinding deck slot and
carefully fill completely with MagBinding Buffer.</li>
<li>Place a deep single-well reservoir in the MagWash 2 deck slot and
carefully fill completely with MagWash 2.</li>
<li>Place sample plates (3), wash plates (3), and elution plate in
respective deck slots.</li>
<li>Confirm all plates are correctly placed in deck slots and begin the
run.</li>
<li>Once the run is complete, use a repeater pipette to add 25 uL of
Magbinding Beads to each well of the 3 sample plates. Make sure to shake
or vortex the MagBinding Beads before pipetting to resuspend the
beads.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>After 40 minutes of vortexing, expel lysate from Sterivex filters
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the male filter cap and insert a 3-ml syringe into the inlet
port (syringe should twist and fit tight).</li>
<li>Gently expel the lysate into the syringe. Some bead carry-over is
common.</li>
<li>Transfer lysate to a labeled and sterile 2-ml microcentrifuge tube
(liquid and beads will reach ~0.75 ml mark ideally).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Centrifuge tubes at ≥ 10,000 x g for 1 min to pellet the beads
and leave the sample as supernatant.</p></li>
<li><p>Gently pipette 250 uL of sample supernatant into respective well
of KingFisher Sample Plate 1, Sample Plate 2 and 3. Repeat for each
sample. If there is less than 750 uL of sample lysate in a
microcentrifuge tube, attempt to pipette even amounts into each of the 3
sample plates.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn on the KingFisher instrument and computer and open up the
BindIt software for KingFisher.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose correct protocol for a 3-plate run.</p></li>
<li><p>Press start and save a new run file (you can create a new file or
save over a previous file that used the same protocol).</p></li>
<li><p>Follow along with instructions on the KingFisher screen to load
the appropriate plates onto the KingFisher carousel and ensure all
plates are in the correct position. Once the last plate has been added,
the run will begin.</p></li>
<li><p>Run will last ~1hr 15min for a 3-plate protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the run is complete, discard the wash, sample and tip
plates. DO NOT THROW OUT ELUTION PLATE.</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer samples in Elution plate (~150 uL per well) to a
permanent 96-well PCR plate for long term storage of DNA at –20 to –80
°C.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Specific to NOAA/AOML: Transfer 50 uL of sample to a 96-well PCR
plate labeled “Working Stock”, another 50 uL of sample to a 96-well
plate labeled “Archive 1”, and the remainder 50 uL of sample to a third
96-well plate labeled “Archive 2”. (see quality control for more
information)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li>Turn off KingFisher instrument and computer.</li>

<h3 id="quality-control">Quality control</h3>
<ul>
<li>An extraction blank (negative control) is included in every
extraction set (93 samples + 1 extraction blank). All samples and
controls are then quantified to confirm DNA concentration. Samples are
also PCR amplified with a NTC and positive controls (Zymo Mock
Community).</li>
<li>Specific to NOAA/AOML: Extracted samples are transferred into 3
aliquots stored at -20°C: a working stock for use in lab (~50 uL),
Archive 1 (~50 uL), and Archive 2 (~50 uL).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="basic-troubleshooting-guide">Basic troubleshooting guide</h3>
<ul>
<li>Issue 1: There have been issues with cracks in the ring around the
inlet ports of Sterivex (usually only one side) and leaks occurring
after thawing.
<ul>
<li>Solution: To make the Sterivex usable, wipe off excess
leakage/condensation on the outside of the sterivex using a KimWipe and
firmly press putty into the concave ring surrounding the inlet ports of
the Sterivex. Then use parafilm to tightly wrap the areas where putty
was applied.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Issue 2: Depending on the type of bracket used on Vortex Genies,
Sterivex may fall out of the brackets as soon as vortexes are turned on.
<ul>
<li>Solution: Use a KimWipe to wipe off excess condensation on the
Sterivex then wrap a small strip of parafilm around the outside of the
Sterivex and clip back into the bracket.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Issue 3: (Opentrons OT-2 Robot) Occasionally the Opentrons OT-2
Robot will have an issue with dispensing liquid because of bubbling
occurring inside the tips dispensing MagBinding buffer due to the
“soapy” nature of the solution.
<ul>
<li>Solution: Press the “Pause” button on the computer and replace the
bubbly tip manually with gloved hands. Then unpause the run and watch to
see if the tip correctly dispenses MagBinding buffer. If a sample plate
has empty wells, use a pipette to manually add MagBinding buffer after
the plate comes off the Opentrons.</li>
