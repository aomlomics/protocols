# BACKGROUND

## Summary

This protocol describes steps for performing PCR for 18S marker gene regions using eDNA extracted from Sterivex at NOAA's AOML. There are several optional steps at the end of the protocol including using AMPure beads to clean up PCR products. Some steps (e.g. PCR plate preparation, AMPure bead cleanup, sequencing plate dilutions) have been or can be optimized for use with the Opentrons OT2 robot.

## Method description and rationale

This protocol is used for PCR amplifying the 18S V9 marker gene regions of environmental DNA. Fluidigm adapters are already present on the primers described in the following protocol. It is highly reproducible and can easily be adapted for any number of samples (i.e. a full 96-well plate or a few samples).

## Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance

This protocol can be used to amplify the 18S marker gene region of any eDNA sample.

# PERSONNEL REQUIRED

One person with molecular biology experience.

## Safety

There are no hazardous chemicals or materials involved in this protocol. Standard lab safety techniques should still be used such as wearing PPE to avoid skin or eye contact.

## Training requirements

Basic molecular biology training is sufficient for this protocol including sterile technique, pipetting small volumes and programming/running PCR thermal cyclers.

## Time needed to execute the procedure

Protocol takes about 4 hours (240 minutes) including thermal cycler run time.

# STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

## Protocol

Preparation

1. Dilute primers from 100 uM to 10 uM if not already at 10uM.
2. Set up PCR under hood by wiping off all surfaces, pipettes, and racks with RNase AWAY and UV sterilizing for 5-10 mins.
3. Map out order of samples on 96-well PCR plate. Make sure to leave a space for a no template control (NTC) and positive control.

### PCR

1. Make PCR master mix and add 24 ul to each well of PCR plate - possible use on Opentrons OT2 Pipetting Robot.
- 12.5 ul AmpliTaq Gold PCR Mix
- 9.5 ul molecular water 
- 1 ul Fwd primer (10 μM) - 1391F
- 1 ul Rev primer (10 μM) - EukBR

| PCR Primer Name | Direction | Sequence (5’ -> 3’) | Sequence (5’ -> 3’) with Fluidigm Adapters | Fluidigm Adapter |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1391F | forward | GTACACACCGCCCGTC | ACACTGACGACATGGTTCTACA xxx GTACACACCGCCCGTC | CS1-TS-F |
| EukBR | reverse | TGATCCTTCTGCAGGTTCACCTAC | TACGGTAGCAGAGACTTGGTCT xxx TGATCCTTCTGCAGGTTCACCTAC | CS2-TS-R |

2. Add 1 ul of sample DNA (or molecular water for NTC) to respective wells for a total reaction volume of 25 ul per well. Pipette up and down or vortex to fully distribute DNA into master mix.

3. Seal plate with PCR plate seal or strip caps.

4. Load plate onto thermal cycler and select program to run the following steps:

| PCR step | Temperature | Duration | Repetition |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Initial Denaturation | 95°C | 180s | 1x |
| Denaturation | 95°C | 45s | 35x |
| Annealing | 57°C | 60s | 35x |
| Extension | 72°C | 90s | 35x |
| Final Extension | 72°C | 10min | 1x |
| Hold | 4°C | ∞ | |

### Quality control, PCR clean-up

2% Agarose Gel
Following PCR amplification, run products through 2% agarose gel to confirm presence of target bands:
1. Make stock solution of TBE buffer (1x) in a 1-L glass container by adding 100 ml of stock TBE buffer (10x) to 900 ml DI water.
2. For a 5.5in x 5.5in gel tray, mix 200 ml of TBE buffer (1x) and 4 g of agarose in a flask. Use scale to weigh agarose.
3. Microwave mixture for 1 minute, followed by 15-30 second intervals. Watch carefully after 1 minute - mixture can bubble out of flask! The agarose should be fully dissolved so that the solution is mostly clear. Wear a protective glove when handling flask as the mixture will be hot.
4. Allow for gel mixture to cool in flask for 5-10 min. While cooling, set up gel tray (5.5in x 5.5in) in gel box. Make sure the tray is oriented properly and sealed tight for gel pouring. Add two gel combs for 20 wells each lane - total of 40 wells.
5. Once cooled to 50°C, add 20 ul of SYBR safe to the mixture and swirl the flask gently to mix (don't create bubbles!). SYBR safe is light sensitive so after adding to mixture, immediately close the vial and store in the dark.
6. Pour the gel mixture and remove any bubbles using a pipette tip.
7. Allow gel to set for 30-45 min.
8. Cut large strips of parafilm or use 8-strip tubes and label each sample as a position on the parafilm/tubes.
9. Pipette 1 ul of blue loading dye onto each sample position or into each tube.
10. Pipette 5 ul of DNA sample into loading dye and pipette to mix 2-3 times.
11. Once the gel is set, fill the gel box with enough TBE buffer (1x) to fully submerge the gel beneath ~1cm of buffer.
12. Carefully add samples (6 ul each) to gel and write down their positions.
13. Add 6 ul of ladder dye (green) to gel.
14. Run gel at 100 V for 40-50 min then visualize on gel reader machine.

(OPTIONAL) Purify PCR products using AMPure beads protocol (optimized for Opentrons)
1. Follow along with AMPure XP beads manufacturer protocol (begins on page 5 of manual - https://www.beckmancoulter.com/wsrportal/techdocs?docname=B37419).
2. Will need magnetic plate and fresh 70% ethanol.
3. End product will be ~40 ul of cleaned DNA eluted in molecular grade water.

(OPTIONAL) Run Qubit on final PCR Products
1. Follow manufacturer protocol for running Qubit: https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/Qubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf.

(OPTIONAL) Run Second 2% Agarose Gel on Purified PCR Products
1. Follow along with previous gel instructions.

## Quality control

The inclusion of a negative control for PCR is to confirm the absence of contamination during the process. The inclusion of a positive control (mock community) is to confirm the PCR is amplifying DNA. There are several optional steps at the end of the process to confirm the presence and concentration of amplified DNA.

## Basic troubleshooting guide

Low Volume Post-PCR
- If using strip-caps, ensure they are tightly fitting on wells. Any gap in the lid will allow for some volume to evaporate during the PCR process on the thermal cycler. If using PCR plate seals, spin down the plate after taking it off the thermal cycler to ensure all condensation is drawn back into the well.

Contamination
- If there are contamination bands appearing on the gel, run another PCR ensuring full sterilization of work spaces and equipment under the hood and use new vials of AmpliTaq Gold and molecular water. If diluted primers are contaminated, use freshly-made aliquot of primers. 

Weak Amplification
- If you are seeing weak amplification bands on the gel, ensure the master mix and DNA is being fully mixed. You can also increase the concentration of primers or tweak the PCR process on the thermal cycler (increasing # of cycles of PCR or optimize annealing temperature). The addition of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) to master mix is also useful in some cases.
