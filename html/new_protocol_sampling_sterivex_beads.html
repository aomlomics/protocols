<h2 id="background">BACKGROUND</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>This protocol describes collection and filtration of marine eDNA
samples using Sterivex cartridge filters and can be adapted to collect
water samples from individual Niskin bottles, CTD Niskin rosettes, or
flow through systems. This protocol is used by NOAA’s AOML GO-SHIP
collaborators.</p>
<h3 id="method-description-and-rationale">Method description and
rationale</h3>
<p>This protocol is used to pump sea water samples collected via Niskin
bottle, CTD Niskin rosettes or flow through systems and pump it through
a 0.22 uM Sterivex filter using a peristaltic pump. Sterivex filters are
loaded with Zymo ZR BashingBeads prior to pumping and DNA/RNA
preservative is immediately added post-pumping to better preserve eDNA
and expedite DNA extraction upon processing in the lab. The recommended
filtration volume for GO-SHIP samples is ~8 liters, which takes ~2
hours. Precautions are taken to minimize contamination of samples by
thoroughly sterilizing all equipment prior to use.</p>
<h3 id="spatial-coverage-and-environments-of-relevance">Spatial coverage
and environment(s) of relevance</h3>
<p>This protocol can be used across any marine environment to
effectively collect water samples for biodviersity monitoring. This
protocol can tolerate a wide range of depths for sampling - NOAA’s AOML
samples from 1m up to 1000m.</p>
<h2 id="personnel-required">PERSONNEL REQUIRED</h2>
<p>One person with pipetting experience. Research vessel experience is
recommended but not required.</p>
<h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>
<p>There are no major safety concerns with this protocol. Standard
precuations should be taken such as wearing PPE at all times to avoid
skin and eye exposure especially when working with bleach.</p>
<h3 id="training-requirements">Training requirements</h3>
<p>Standard moleculary biology training including sterile technique and
pipetting technique is required to properly conduct this protocol.
Research vessel experience is recommended. Personnel should be trained
in filtering protocol prior to conducting on ship.</p>
<h3 id="time-needed-to-execute-the-procedure">Time needed to execute the
procedure</h3>
<p>The process of setting up sampling equipment and filtering seawater
will take ~2 hours (depending on number of samples).</p>

<h2 id="standard-operating-procedure">STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE</h2>
<h3 id="protocol">Protocol</h3>
<h3 id="sampling">Sampling</h3>
<p>Preparation</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Prepare a 1:20 dilution bleach solution by mixing 1 part household
bleach (5-9% sodium hypochlorite) with DI water and storing in an 8 L
carboy.</li>
<li>Wearing gloves, prepare the Sterivex filters by carefully adding 1
tube of Zymo ZR BashingBeads. It is recommended to cut off the top half
of a 1000 uL tip and place it into the top of the Sterivex filter to act
as a funnel while pouring beads into the Sterivex.</li>
<li>Label each Sterivex filter with a pre-printed sticker.</li>
<li>Attach hose-barb adapter to one end of peristaltic pump tubing.</li>
<li>Attach serological pipette to other end of peristaltic pump
tubing.</li>
<li>Sterilize 60 mL syringe with 1:20 dilution bleach solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sampling</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Rinse 20-L carboy 2 times with ~100 mL of sample water (200 mL
total)</li>
<li>Wearing gloves, collect water from the flow-through system (or
Niskin bottles) into 20-L carboy.</li>
<li>Place serological pipettes into bag(s) or bottle(s), ensuring the
other end of the tubing (with hose-barb) is flowing into the graduated
cyclinders.</li>
<li>Turn on the pump and run ~100 mL of seawater to prime the
tubing.</li>
<li>Run the pump at 100-150 rpm.</li>
<li>Pause the pump and discard water.</li>
</ol>
<p>Filtration</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Attach the Sterivex filter input to the hose-barb that is already
attached to the tubing outflow. The filter should screw on tightly.
Avoid handling Sterivex filter input or output ends.</li>
<li>Run the pump and filter seawater until ~8 L has been filtered,
measured using the graduated cyclinders or another container.</li>
<li>On the log sheet, record the date, time, latitute, longitude, volume
filtered and any notes about the sample. This information should be
entered into an Excel spreadsheet every few days to maintain a digital
copy in addition to the paper copy.</li>
<li>Pause pump and open pump head valves to release pressure.</li>
<li>Unscrew and remove Sterivex filters from the hose-barb
adapters.</li>
<li>Gently remove any excess seawater from the filters using a
sterilized 60 mL syringe.</li>
<li>Cap the bottom end (outlet) of the Sterivex filter with a female
luer-lock cap.</li>
<li>In between filtering different water samples, rinse out the tubing
with 1:20 dilution bleach solution, followed by DI water. Then proceed
with the next volume of seawater.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sample preservation</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Using a P1000 (1000 uL pipette), gently add 1000 uL of DNA/RNA
Shield preservative into the Sterivex.</li>
<li>Cap the top end (inlet) of the Sterivex with a male luer-lock
cap.</li>
</ol>
<p>Storage</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Freeze at ≥ –20 °C until extraction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Post-Sampling 1. Return the bottle of DNA/RNA Shield to a
refrigerator to reduce contamination. 2. Run ~1 L of 5% bleach through
the lines to clean pump tubing. Repeat with ~1 L of deionized water. 3.
Rinse the 20 L collection carboy 3 times with ~0.5 L DI water (1.5 L
total) after sampling.</p>
<h3 id="quality-control">Quality control</h3>
<p>Negative field controls are included with every research cruise.
After the addition of Zymo ZR BashingBeads to a new Sterivex filter, DI
water is filtered in place of sea water and then DNA/RNA Shield is
added. These Sterivex are stored the same as other sample Sterivex.</p>
<h3 id="basic-troubleshooting-guide">Basic troubleshooting guide</h3>
<p>Leaks</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a leak present in the pump setup, you will notice
trouble pulling water through the pump system. Check all seals and
re-attach tubing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clogged Filter</p>
<ul>
<li>If a filter is clogged, turn valves and connections off and attempt
to clear obstructions (i.e. large chunks of sediment or algae). Make
note of any abnormal conditions and try to pump the full volume of
seawater through the filter. In more productive areas, especially
surface samples, we would frequently have filters that could not take
the full volume. Since there are only two pumps and multiple sample
depths at one time, it was common for us to use a cut-off time before
starting next sample (~45 min).</li>
